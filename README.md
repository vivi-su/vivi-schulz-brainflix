### BrainFlix
BrainFlix is a React application that encompasses both the frontend and backend, with Express.js powering the server. It allows users to navigate through a collection of videos, access their metadata, and read associated comments. In this project, photos are palced in lieu of videos, with the primary focus being on state management and establishing connections to the backend through read routes.
